Usage
-----

*SpriteOutlineFx* draws contour lines of alpha channel values.
And therefore the following points should be kept in mind.

- Clear the alpha channel using the cameraâ€™s clear color.
- Use a color mask to draw sprites/objects without outlines.

See the example project for further details.
